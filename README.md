# Phonebook

## Introduction

The increase in the availability of phones and the desire for many to have a phone or more has led to the need for each 
telephone user to have a way of recalling the telephone number of one another. The Phone Book app will solve the basic 
requirement of storing the contact details of persons like phone number and Email address.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to design a phone book application that can allow users to store the contact details of 
persons and the information will be used to send either email or SMS.
